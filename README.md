# Description
This project inlcude codes to train a tuned Convolutional neural network model using

# Dataset
The Dataset should be located in a folder and its path properly identified as an input to the main function

The models to be optimized should be accordingly made configurable. The data loaders should also be in the same fashion. These codes were tested with models and dataloaders in pytorchlightning.



# Dependencies
The code is written in python, and uses pytorch, pytorchlightning and comet.
